Make sure to disable filament ramming under: Printer settings > Multimaterial.


Copy and paste start and end gCodes into the respective sections in Orcaslicer:

Printer settings > machine start G-code.

Printer settings > machine end G-code.

Printer settings > before layer change G-code.

There is a file for each toolhead containing the respective start and end gcodes for each.

I have also included the Orcaslicer profiles themselves which you should be able to simply import via the file dropdown menu at the top left corner of Orcaslicer.
